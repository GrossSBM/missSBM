> When a network is partly observed (here, NAs in the adjacency matrix rather than 1 or 0  due to missing information between node pairs), it is possible to account for the underlying process that generates those NAs. 'missSBM' adjusts the popular stochastic block model from network data  sampled under various missing data conditions, as described in Tabouy, Barbillon and Chiquet (2019) [10.1080/01621459.2018.1562934](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2018.1562934).
